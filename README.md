## Components

- [`@millenniumdb/graph-explorer`](./packages/graph-explorer/README.md) â€“ Interactive graph visualization component.

## Development

Start the component development environment with:

```sh
pnpm run storybook
```

This command launches [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - an interactive environment for developing and testing UI components in isolation. It opens a local server where you can preview, debug, and document your components live.
